Notes:


* If something isn't working right and you have the time to spare, could you please send an email as well as commenting. It greatly speeds up fixing things if we can ask for more detail on the problem than Market comments allow (although we do appreciate those too).

* If the app ""goes missing"" after a recent update, I'm informed that uninstalling+reinstalling it using ""Settings>Applications>Manage Applications"" should restore it.

* If you have a homescreen icon on an HTC Sense phone, the picture will not be updated until you reboot. However, it should function just as before without a reboot. We can't do anything about this issue as it appears to be an HTC bug.

* We are unable to use the new pre-caching or vector maps support as seen in the most recent Google Maps versions. These features are only available internally within the Google Maps application itself, and Google have made no way to use them from an external application.

org.mrchops.android.digihud,DigiHUD Speedometer,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mrchops.android.digihud&hl=en&gl=in,"<strong>100% ad-free, doesn't require data/cell connection to work.</strong>

DigiHUD Speedometer is a free GPS based digital head up display (HUD) that shows useful speed and distance information for your journey. Ideal if your vehicle speedo has died, you want to verify your vehicle speed or you just want to know your speed when cycling, running, flying, sailing etc.!
The display can be switched between normal viewing and HUD mode which mirrors the display for viewing as a reflection in a vehicle windshield (most useful at night, depending on the device's brightness). 
DigiHUD can open as a floating window on top of other apps or your homescreens. Works with external GPS receivers (tested at 10Hz). 

<strong>Although we strive to make all readings as accurate as possible they are only as accurate as your device's GPS sensor and should only be regarded as approximations.</strong>

<i>For more than a dozen extra features, with many more planned, try <strong>DigiHUD Pro</strong> (link at the bottom of this description).</i>

<strong>Information displayed</strong>
Current speed (choose MPH, KMH or KTS)
Average speed, since reset
Maximum speed, since reset
Three Trip distance counters
Compass
Odometer (found under Statistics)
Current time
Digit color changes to red when above your set warning speed
Battery level indicator
Satellite lock status icon

<strong>Using DigiHUD</strong>
Lite Mode (speed only) - swipe the speed left or right. Swipe again to return
HUD Mode (mirrored) - swipe the speed up or down. Swipe again to return
Touch the trip counter to cycle through the three counters
Long-pressing on a speed or trip value will reset it
Long-press the speed unit to choose between MPH, KMH and KTS from the popup menu (also in the Main Menu)

When in window mode touch the DigiHUD icon for a menu to switch to the fullscreen app or exit. The window can be re-sized using the corner drag handle.

All values can be reset by long-pressing ""PAUSE RESET"" (the Odometer reading in the Statistics popup won't reset and counts the total distance since the application was installed or it's data was cleared). 

<strong>Main Menu</strong>
Opened by touching the speed displayed in the center of the screen, the menu allows you to:
Exit DigiHUD
Window/Background Mode: Close and open as a re-sizable floating window
HUD view / Normal view: Switch between HUD (mirrored) and normal displays
Speed Unit: Change between MPH, KMH or KTS

Lock screen rotation: keep the screen in its current rotation even if the device is rotated 
Display Preferences: enable/disable screen elements

Help: show help and other information

*This application requires the use of the GPS receiver, which may increase battery usage.*

Soviet Military Maps is the perfect moving map app for offroad trips, adventure travels and expeditions. You are planning cross country trips to Sahara desert or a trekking tour to the Himalayas ? With the Russian topos you have always a great alternative to other map sources. Beneath the good topography the maps include many small trails and unpaved roads that are missing in other map sets.
The Russian maps have additional English labels.
Attention: The Soviet Military Maps were created mainly in the 80ies and are less interesting for industrialized countries. Outside Africa and Asia you'll find the OSM / Google map layers more useful.
Please note: This app does not provide direct ""Turn-by-Turn"" navigation - but with a selected waypoint you can easily switch to Google Navigation.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Backpacking

Gaia GPS is first and foremost a backpacking app. View your route using comprehensive topo maps and backpacking map layers, plus up-to-date weather forecast overlays. Then, use the intelligent routing tools to plan trips, mark campsites and points of interest, and measure distance, altitude, and elevation change.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Camping and Overlanding 

A camping app with weather forecasts, public land data, and community-sourced camping beta, Gaia GPS helps you find a campsite anywhere. View dispersed camping areas on the Public Land overlay, and leave waypoints to create custom camping maps. Reference road maps and MVUMs to plot overland, 4x4, or off-roading routes.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Backcountry Skiing and Mountaineering

Apply slope-angle shading and 24-, 48-,and 72-hour Snowfall and Precipitation Forecast overlays to create custom backcountry skiing maps, plan tours, and avoid avalanche terrain. Gaia GPS is the best skiing app for staying safe deep in the backcountry.

‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ Mountain Biking

The Thomas Cook India App is here to make all your holiday dreams come true. 
Thomas Cook India‚Äôs holiday app is the answer to everything travel - from exploring holiday packages ranging from international and domestic tour packages, to helping with foreign exchange and visa assistance to allowing you to book flights and even book hotels, all through just one convenient app on your smartphone. 
A must have travel and holiday app, the Thomas Cook India App is the proud recipient of many digital awards for excellence and innovation such as:
The IAMAI-India Digital Award for ‚ÄòBest Travel Website‚Äô
The DMAi Echo Award (Silver in Digital Marketing) for Happily Ever After
The India Digital Crest Awards (Bronze) for Excellence in Digital Search
The IMA Award for Marketing on a Small Budget.
In keeping with the Digital India movement, Thomas Cook India wanted to provide Indian travelers with a platform to book their India and International holiday packages with ease, but which also allowed them to address their forex and visa application-related needs. Thus, the Thomas Cook India App was created out of the need for such a holistic, well-rounded, 360-degree approach to trip planning. Whether you‚Äôre out and about, on the go or sitting in confines of your home, the Thomas Cook India App is the only trip-planner app you need. 
Whatever your travel needs - window shopping for an international honeymoon package for you and your spouse or checking out a domestic holiday package for the family. Whether you want to buy foreign currency before you travel or sell forex after you return, the Thomas Cook India App, will make it as convenient for you as shopping online or sharing your latest international holiday photos on Instagram. And let‚Äôs not forget the all-important component of travel insurance, the app will tick that box for you as well. 
While on vacation, should the need for finances arise, juggling banking apps and checking currency exchange rates can be confusing. Thankfully, with the Thomas Cook India App, all your forex-related needs are covered thanks to the app‚Äôs forex section. Here you will find the necessary tools that allow you to buy forex or sell forex anywhere in the world with an internet connection. 
If you do buy forex through the app, you also have the option to send money electronically to a beneficiary as opposed to withdrawing it, which may or may not result in fees and surcharges tied to the withdrawal of money internationally. Running short on money but don‚Äôt want to buy more forex? The app allows you the flexibility to receive money from a benefactor. This feature also comes in handy when you‚Äôre travelling with companions and wish to spilt bills and other costs electronically.




After all your forex transactions are completed, the app gives you a concise and clear overview of all your forex remittances so you can track your travel budget more effectively, which helps you make adjustments to your travel plans on the go. This has the added advantage of keeping you appraised of your spending in real time as opposed to being hit with a statement of transactions after you‚Äôve had a great holiday and are back home. 
The Thomas Cook India Holiday and Forex app is your source for the best international packages, superior domestic packages, foreign currency, visa or flight booking assistance, right in the palm of your hand.

<b>Offline Train Schedules</b>
 
The train app has the Indian Railways timetable offline. You don't have to know train number or names as our Smart search feature allows you to use train source & destination or partial train names even with spelling errors.
 
<b>Coach Layout and Platform numbers</b>

Starting with all prices starting at retail prices, the prices of your favourite drink rise in direct proportion to its consumption over a period of time at the bar.

Attention: The Soviet Military Maps were created mainly in the 80ies and are less interesting for industrialized countries. Outside Africa and Asia you'll find the OSM / Google map layers more useful.

Bluetooth devices must be paired to be seen by this app.  Pair the devices using Android network settings before using this app for Bluetooth.  Please read the manual before using: https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume/wiki/Manual .  

Please post any issues to the issues list https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume/issues .  I can only fix problems I know about and I need to know the details of the problems to fix them.

The ""stored location"" button will retrieve the location of the last Bluetooth device that disconnected while the service was running.  Setting the preference ""notify in foreground"" and ""start at boot"" will ensure the service is running when needed.  

Android 9.0 and up no longer need the media volume adjust feature as this is built into the OS.  In fact, if you use the media volume adjustment feature of A2DP Volume it will fight with the volume adjust feature in the OS. Therefore the volume adjustment feature should not be used for Android 9.0 and up devices.

-New ‚ÄúRide Now‚Äù and ‚ÄúWait to Ride‚Äù recommendations to show whether waits are going up or down at your favorite rides.

-Customized step-by-step touring plans for both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. You tell LINES which rides you want to see, and LINES will create a step-by-step itinerary showing when to go to each ride to avoid long lines. You can even change your plans while you‚Äôre in the park!

-A Crowd Calendar showing you how busy each park will be over the next ten days.

-Disney‚Äôs official app doesn‚Äôt show you the waits for many attractions or character greetings. LINES has wait times for more rides, shows, and character greetings than even Disney‚Äôs own app.

-See which rides still have FASTPASS ride reservations for the rest of the day.

-Ask questions and get fast answers from our online community of 120,000 Disney experts.

-Menus and prices for every restaurant, kiosk, food stand, and cart in all of Disneyland Resort ‚Äì more than 6,000 things to eat! Every menu is searchable ‚Äì you can find every steak in California Adventure or throughout the parks, Downtown Disney, and the official Disneyland Resort Hotels!

‚óè OVERVIEW ‚óè The London Tube Map application is a superb route planner for the London Underground (Tube)system with many unique features. The inbuilt map provides the official TFL map of the city underground services with the ability to switch to an online street map view when an internet connection is available. This way the user can view the online map feature when above ground and the transport map and route planning is still fully functional underground or anywhere there is no internet connection. This provides the best of both worlds, the transport map and route planning anytime, anywhere and online street maps and search when a connection is available. 

‚óè ROUTING ‚óè Does not require an internet connection and will always be available to display a clear and detailed view of the city transport system, plus list and animate the optimum route for your journey. Provides the fastest route calculations of any mobile routing application (virtually instantaneous) using actual published journey times with the ability to select the quickest route or the route with the least changes. 

Comprehensive details of your planned route are provided, including changes, directions of travel, number of stops, predicted journey times, etc. Uniquely this application gives you ‚Äúdirection‚Äù, ‚Äútowards‚Äù and ‚Äúservice frequency‚Äù information (not available on any other offline journey planner) for example ‚ÄúTake the Northern line (Southbound) towards Stockwell for 10 mins (6 stops). Service runs every 7 minutes‚Äù which is essential when finding the correct platform and connection. Also given are alternatives for each leg of the journey. 

‚óè NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED ‚óè The tube map and routing do not require an internet connection and therefore you will not be charged data connection fees. This also means the application runs perfectly underground, on an aeroplane, etc. For international visitors to a city who have data roaming turned off this is an ideal solution. 

‚óè LIVE INFO ‚óè When an internet connection is available, optional ""Live Information"" on the current state of the transport services and real time station departure boards can be viewed allowing you to plan your journeys in advance and avoid any potential delays. Unique to this application is the ability to turn off services that are out of action and automatically calculate an alternative route.

This is helpful for getting a sense of scale and connectivity of the transport system and can provide some interesting results.",Offline tube map and route planner for the London underground,Maps & Navigation,1000000,4.343488,13108,2814,848,639,668,1957,8996,TRUE,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/U76TncxrlGImvNuLTLYBfR3vHmiX5hhiXvb-in2AN9eKyhy9YC1vVmp-vta8Ha_JfWiX,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/3GbXBvCVQBfIXGjwaP_fK7siPxVUVr9euNuLgcUEYLCL7xVJZ1ioIW6CCS8iOeG_xA

Track fuel consumption, maintenances and costs!
Track and log your mileage, fuel consumption, maintenances, services and costs of your car or motorbike and know exactly how much your car costs. FuelLog calculates a lot of useful statistics like fuel consumption and economy (e.g. mpg or l/100km) of your car or other vehicle, total cost and mileage, average cost per distance or gas amount, average cost per month, year and driven distances, expenses and a lot more. Everything is managed in a nice-looking and very easy to use interface.

Track all kind of costs and maintenances/services like for example monthly insurance, daily bridge toll, yearly taxes, services, car parts, parking costs, oil or tyre changes, and a lot more... (limited to 15 entries in the free version)

FuelLog is probably the first and only app in this category that supports also electric cars using kWh, CNG cars using kg or gge and other vehicles with an hour meter!

6 different nice-looking graphical charts show the fill ups (only Android 2.1 and newer)

Use the included calculator to calculate costs, used/needed fuel volumes and distances for your next trip or the daily way to work with your car, based on the automatically gathered statistical data.

Of course FuelLog supports multiple cars and it is usable in every country because it supports and converts Kilometre/Miles, Litres/Gallons(US)/Gallons(UK), mpg/l/100km defined individually per vehicle and every known currency.

The stored fill ups and costs can be exported as a *.csv file for further calculations on your computer or just to be saved as a backup on your sdcard. If you have stored your gas purchases and maintenances/services on the computer or if you want to restore a previous backup, you can import the data in FuelLog (only FuelLogPro). If you have problems importing your data or if you want to convert an export from another App, from the iPhone or from a website, just send me an email, I will help you!

The user interface is very easy to use, intuitive, clear and simple and informative, nice and ""android-like"".

* System boot: Up until now, any reminders set via this app were deleted when rebooting the smartphone. This error did not affect e-mail reminders. With this new permission, the reminders will be reregistered in the system upon each reboot.

* Access to protected storage: This will enable the ALDI USA app to allow Google Maps to cache the map. The ALDI USA app will not directly access your external storage media.

teamDoppelGanger.SmarterSubway,Korean Subway : Smarter Subway,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=teamDoppelGanger.SmarterSubway&hl=en&gl=in,"Hi. This is Smarter Subway.
The ""Smarter Subway"", which has been loved by many users steadily since its first appearance on February 17, 2011, was reborn in June 2017 with a new look.

Check out the latest subway map and latest timetable from the new Smarter Subway to the metropolitan area (Seoul Subway, Gyeonggi Subway, Incheon Subway) / Daejeon Subway / Daegu Subway / Busan Subway / Gwangju Subway!

1. Conveniently search for subway stations and routes

‚Ä¢ Station name search - If you do not know the location of the station you want to find on the subway map, you can search for the station name and find it. 
‚Ä¢ Quick Search - This function allows you to quickly find routes by combining station search and route search. You can set your favorite ""station"" as a departure / arrival station for convenience. 
‚Ä¢ Recent Search - Allows you to search back to the most recently searched route.

2. We will inform you of the correct arrival time and station information of the subway.

We provide train timetables using official city rail data and provide real-time arrival time information in case train arrives late or arrives early. You can also use real-time arrival information for bus stops and available bus lines around the station, and map information around the station. You can also check out various restaurants, coupons, job information and weather information around the station.

3. We recommend the best route according to the user's situation

""Smarter Subway"" has increased convenience by introducing a dynamic result screen that allows you to change the route from time to time in the Route Results screen instead of the static result window. In the route result, you can select again the departing station, the arrival station / day / time, and you can check the previous / next train of the searched route immediately.

4. We will inform you of the express subway route conveniently.

In the meantime, users really gave a lot of opinions about the inconvenience to the expressway route map. We have added a detailed view of the subway line express to see at a glance what kind of express trains exist for each subway line, which express train stops at which station, and when the express train departure time is at the station.

5. Arrival alarms are smarter

Alarms are now more accurate, preventing you from losing your station while you sleep or work on the subway. You can conveniently check which stations are on the route to be moved, which station you are currently moving through, and when you arrive at the station you need to get off, you will be notified of the exact vibration / ring tone.

6. National subway information

(Seoul, Gyeonggi, Incheon) Subway Line, Busan Subway Line, Daegu Subway Line, Daejeon Subway Line, Gwangju Subway Line

I don't support this app anymore. It is for free now.

This is just a license key to unlock additional features in FuelLog. You have to install FuelLog (the free one) too. Don't uninstall FuelLog. FuelLogPro can not be started directly and does not show up in the normal app menu. After the installation of the FuelLogPro Key just use FuelLog as usual and the additional pro features will be unlocked.
You probably have to close FuelLog (menu - exit) after installing FuelLogPro to get rid of the Ads.

Track fuel consumption, maintenances and costs!
Track and log your mileage, fuel consumption, maintenances, services and costs of your car or motorbike and know exactly how much your car costs. FuelLog calculates a lot of useful statistics like fuel consumption and economy (e.g. mpg or l/100km) of your car or other vehicle, total cost and mileage, average cost per distance or gas amount, average cost per month, year and driven distances, expenses and a lot more. Everything is managed in a nice-looking and very easy to use interface. Track all of your car expenses and save money.

Track all kind of costs and maintenances/services like for example monthly insurance, daily bridge toll, yearly taxes, services, car parts, parking costs, oil or tyre changes, and a lot more...

FuelLog is probably the first and only app in this category that supports also electric cars using kWh, CNG cars using kg or gge and other vehicles using an hour meter!

6 different nice-looking graphical charts show the fill ups (only Android 2.1 and newer).

Use the included calculator to calculate costs, used/needed fuel volumes and distances for your next trip or the daily way to work with your car, based on the automatically gathered statistical data.

Of course FuelLog supports multiple cars and it is usable in every country because it supports and converts Kilometre/Miles/Hours, Litres/Gallons(US)/Gallons(UK), mpg/l/100km defined individually per vehicle and every known currency.

The stored fill ups and costs can be exported as a *.csv file for further calculations on your computer or just to be saved as a backup on your sdcard. If you have stored your gas purchases and maintenances/services on the computer or if you want to restore a previous backup, you can import the data in FuelLog.

The user interface is very easy to use, intuitive, clear and simple and informative, nice and ""android-like"".

-Both Disney‚Äôs currently posted wait time at every attraction and how long you‚Äôll REALLY wait in line, based on our experience and that of thousands of families on the same ride. 

-New ‚ÄúRide Now‚Äù and ‚ÄúWait to Ride‚Äù recommendations to show whether waits are going up or down at your favorite rides.

-Customized step-by-step touring plans for each Disney park. You tell LINES which rides you want to see, and LINES will create a step-by-step itinerary showing when to go to each ride to avoid long lines. You can even change your plans while you‚Äôre in the park!

-Disney‚Äôs official app doesn‚Äôt show you the waits for many attractions or character greetings. LINES has wait times for more rides, shows, and character greetings than even Disney‚Äôs own app.

-See which rides still have FastPass+ ride reservations for the rest of the day. This is incredibly useful if you‚Äôre trying to plan your afternoon and evening, if you want to know whether FastPass+ is available at Splash Mountain after your nap, or if trying to decide which park to go to after dinner.

In addition, you can create groups for different events, create multiple lists per group and invite multiple members. E.g. for family, roommates, office, wedding, vacation, party planning, etc.
 
To briefly clarify, each group has its own <b>chat with picture and text messages</b>. Helpful if you don't know which shampoo to buy? Or who will bring the barbecue charcoal after Max has cancelled at short notice? 

With the group chat you can rely on the fact that the messages are sent to all group members. You don't have to create a group in WhatsApp first. Or worry about whether everyone is on WhatsApp? Or Facebook Messenger, Telegram or Viber.

Here's how you can <b>create long lists quickly</b>: (see picture #3)
‚Ä¢ Suggested items from your master list appear after you type two letters. Click on it to add the desired item.
‚Ä¢ Select items from the master list and add them with one click.
‚Ä¢ Create a shopping list of items you buy regularly, select all items with one click and add them to the preferred list.

Display shopping lists either <b>categorized, alphabetically sorted or manually sorted</b> (see picture #4). Each shopping list can have its own sorting.

In the supermarket you <b>do not</b> have to scroll the list, because if you sort the items into categories and set the category order for the supermarket, the items will appear one after the other as you go through the supermarket. Crossed-off items and whole categories are placed at the end of the list (see picture #5).

Create <b>recipes</b> with ingredients, directions and pictures. With a few clicks you can add all ingredients to a shopping list (see picture #6).

Add <b>pictures to items</b> to always buy the right shampoo, cat food or coffee.

Do you still have something to do? Write it down in the <b>task lists</b>.

There are 4 different <b>designs</b> including Dark theme, 4 font sizes and 6 fonts to choose from.

Additional features:
‚Ä¢ If necessary you can edit the master list (including categories, units, stores) in the management menu
‚Ä¢ The shopping mode enlarges the lines and makes it easier to cross off items in the supermarket
‚Ä¢ Reminders
‚Ä¢ Barcode scanner
‚Ä¢ Resolve inputs with quantity and price, e.g. 500g tomatoes 2.99
‚Ä¢ Edit all items of a shopping list in a single view

<b>Data security and authorisations.</b>

What permissions does SBB Mobile need and why?

<b>Location:</b>  
For connections from your current location, the GPS function must be activated so that SBB Mobile can find the nearest stop. This also applies if you want to have the nearest stop displayed in the timetable.

<b>Calendar and e-mail:</b>  
You can save connections in your own calendar and send them by e-mail (to friends, an external calendar). SBB Mobile requires read and write permissions to be able to import your desired connection into the calendar.

<b>Access to the camera:</b>  
In order to take photos for the personalised touch timetable in SBB Mobile itself, the app requires access to your camera. You will be asked for permission under the menu item ‚Äúhardware controls Android camera‚Äù.

<b>Internet access:</b>  
SBB Mobile requires Internet access to timetable information and Ticket Shop data so that the app can answer your enquiries.

<b>Memory:</b>

Listing the full depth of our content would be a bit for this space, plus some would think it's spam!


About our guides:

We make awesome travel guides using smart algorithms. To do this, we crawl data from open content sources like World66, Wikivoyage, Wikipedia, Open Street Maps, TouristEye and Flickr. Once we have all the data, it‚Äôs time to parse. From each source, we extract all the information we can. Afterwards, we start identifying patterns and matching to come up with one complete record for each location. Now it‚Äôs time to determine what is most relevant to travelers. We use traveler‚Äôs photos and keyword density to analyze our content. Once we‚Äôve got the most important data, we create the most comprehensive mobile travel guides.


Customizing the app

We setup the app according to your locale, but if you want otherwise, you can set your home currency (for the currency converter) if you tap the top bar and choose Account. There you can also switch between imperial and metric units (fahrenheit/celsius, feet/meters) for the weather forecast temperatures and for distances.

That server places a cookie in your browser. If you end up purchasing something from Woot.com using your mobile device, that cookie is used to give me credit for sending you there.

com.myibidder.aclient1,Myibidder Auction Bid Sniper for eBay,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myibidder.aclient1&hl=en&gl=in,"Snipe to win on eBay.
Myibidder Bid Sniper is a sniper for eBay buyers that places the last seconds bids to increase your chances to win.
No need to watch for auctions anymore, just set a snipe and let the sniper do the job for you.
Once your snipe is set, you don't need to keep the app running for the snipe to work.

You get 10 free credits when you start using the app which can be used towards winning auctions.
Credits are used for won items only. If you did not win an item (your bid was too low, seller did not accept it, etc), the snipe can be re-used for future listings.
Auctions won with bids lower than 10.00 (any currency) are free.
When your balance goes to zero, you will get one free credit next day to keep the fun going. Good for occasional snipers.
You can get more credits in the ""Balance"" menu option by buying credits in bulk or get them for free by watching ads. This helps to support the service.

A guide for a new user:
1. Create an account for sniping using ""Create Account"" link on the Login screen
2. Link your eBay account using ""eBay Account"" menu option after you login

Step by step instructions on how to add an item for sniping:
http://www.myibidder.com/forums/viewtopic/3719/howto-how-to-add-a-snipe-to-android-app/

========================================================
For those who never used eBay sniper in the past:
1. Sniping does not guarantee winning. you have to meet eBay's and seller's requirements in order to win.
Also, your snipe must be ready (added & activated) at least 3 minutes in advance.

2. You can stop sniping if you have at least 1-2 minutes to delete the item from your list or set ""off"" on ""Activate"" on the Snipe screen and save the change.

3. The sniper does not track the current bid in real-time. The current bid does not affect sniping anyway.
